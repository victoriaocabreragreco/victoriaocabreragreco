👋 Hi there, I’m Vicky Cabrera

I’m a system engineer who’s lived across different countries — something that’s made me open-minded, adaptable, and endlessly curious. I’m currently diving deeper into machine learning and AI, always exploring how tech can solve real-world problems that matter.

🧠 Most of what I’ve built — from image classifiers and NER chatbots to full-stack ML apps — has come from self-driven projects, a love for problem-solving, and a commitment to keep learning. I’m especially excited about using data and AI to make an impact in healthcare, accessibility, and everyday life.

*What excites me most is using data and technology for something bigger. That’s the kind of impact I want to create.* ❤️
